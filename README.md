Author= Kristen Davis


# Project Overview    
This project analyzes the studio movie industry. Descriptive analytics show that there is a dominant formula for creating high grossing movies. Microsoft can use this infomation to make a data driven choice on what type of content they should produce. 

# Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
